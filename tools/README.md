This a collection of golang code to help manage comic books.

## desadulate

Take a comic book archive and make it less sad:

  *  order pages in the archive by reading order
  *  add/update ComicBook.xml to the archive and mark it optimized-for-streaming
  *  optionally update all images to webp format (saves on space)
